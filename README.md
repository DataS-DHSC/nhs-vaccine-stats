## Usage

Use RStudio to run the various Rmd files.

### Getting the data (work in progress)

This will soon be automated; until then, you can download the latest data yourself from: https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/covid-19-vaccinations/

### Creating charts (work in progress)

For each chart of interest, there will be an associated Rmd file, e.g. `01_vaccine_coverage.Rmd`. You can run this file in RStudio to create the desired chart output.

### Creating slides (work in progress)

In RStudio, open the relevant Rmd file, e.g. `SPI-M_summary_YYYY-MM-DD.Rmd`, and use the Knit feature to generate the slides.
